# 📦 AWS Networks: Creating a Private Subnet

## 🛠 About the Project
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **Private Subnet** within an Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). It covers creating a dedicated route table, setting up a custom network ACL, and understanding the difference between public and private subnets for enhanced cloud resource security.

All architecture diagrams, configuration details, and explanations are documented inside the provided PDF file.
